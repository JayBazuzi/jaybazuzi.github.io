| Problem               | Description                                                                                                                | Action                                                | Less bad             | Example |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Missing               | A chunk of code is different than the code around it, but is not nameable.                                                 | Extract Applesauce                                    | Nonsense             |         |
| Bald-faced lie        | A name is lying to the reader, inviting an incorrect but confident understanding of the code.                              | Rename to Applesauce                                  | Nonsense             |         |
| Lie of omission       | The name is true but incomplete; the hidden truth makes it misleading.                                                     | Rename to _OrSomething                                | (fully) Honest       |         |
| Incomplete            | The name is honest about its incompletenes, meaning we have to read the method to learn the rest of the truth.             | Read the body and Rename to And..And...And..And...And | Honest and Complete  |         |
| Does the wrong things | The fully honest and complete name contains things that go together and things that do not.                                | Extract-and-Inline / Inline-and-Extract               | Does the Right Thing |         |
| Wrong parameter       | Parameter that the caller doesn't care about; parameter only used by the first or last statements of the method            | Extract-and-Inline / Inline-and-Extract               | Does the Right Thing |         |
| Lego Name             | The long name made up of a lot of basic parts is difficult to work with, and it's unclear why the caller is calling it.    | Rename or Extract                                     | Intent               |         |
| In the wrong place    | This responsibilty is on the wrong class.                                                                                  | Extract Class                                         |                      |         |
| Birds of a feather    | Several methods on a class are related to each other (same words in their names) but different from the rest of the class. | Extract Class                                         |                      |         |
| Repeated parameters   | Several methods take many of the same parameters.                                                                          | Extract Parameter Object and Move Method              |
