This week we ran a #mobprogramming session with 38 people. Here are the deets:

At Tableau, every developer gets training in Arlo Belshee's _Read-by-Refactoring_. It's an experiential class, where the attendees are invited to work on a familiar problem (Reading gnarly, untested legacy code) while the instructors coach them into discovering new patterns of thinking. Since our goal is first to change how programmers' fingers work, mobbing is far more effective than a lecture.
